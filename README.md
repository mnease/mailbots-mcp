**Give your AI tools access to your email. Search, read, send, and manage messages across multiple accounts without leaving your terminal.**

</div>

mailbox-mcp is an [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) that connects your email to Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or any AI tool that supports the Model Context Protocol. Instead of switching between your terminal and Gmail, you ask the AI to find that invoice, summarize a thread, or draft a reply — and it does.

**What makes this different from the 60+ other email MCP servers:**

- **Multiple accounts, one server.** Work email, personal email, client accounts — all accessible through a single server. No need to run separate instances.
- **Not just Gmail.** Supports Gmail (full API), any IMAP/SMTP provider (ProtonMail, corporate mail, self-hosted), and JMAP (Fastmail, Stalwart, Topicbox). Add providers without changing a line of tool code.
- **Security-conscious.** Encrypted credentials (AES-256-GCM), prompt injection fencing on email content, rate limiting, TLS enforcement, SSRF protection with IP encoding evasion detection, input validation.
- **Tools for the workflows that matter.** Search, read, send, reply, forward, drafts, labels, filters, templates, signatures, vacation replies, attachments, unsubscribe, and more.
- **Zero native dependencies.** Pure Node.js. Install and run anywhere.

## Quick Start

### Install

Add to your Claude Code MCP config (`~/.claude.json`). The package runs straight from npm via `npx`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mailbox": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mailbox-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MAILBOX_MCP_PASSPHRASE": "a-long-random-passphrase"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`MAILBOX_MCP_PASSPHRASE` is the passphrase used to encrypt IMAP/JMAP credentials at rest; it's required before adding an IMAP or JMAP account, and unused for Gmail-only setups.

<summary>From source instead</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jgalea/mailbox-mcp.git
cd mailbox-mcp
npm install && npm run build
```

Then point the config at the build with `"command": "node", "args": ["/path/to/mailbox-mcp/dist/server.js"]`.

### Add a Gmail Account

#### 1. Create a Google Cloud project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project
2. Enable the **Gmail API**: [APIs & Services > Library > Gmail API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/gmail.googleapis.com) > Enable

#### 2. Set up OAuth consent screen

1. Go to [Google Auth Platform > Branding](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/branding)
2. Set **App name** and **User support email**
3. Go to [Audience](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience), select **External**
4. Add the Google account you'll sign in with as a **test user** (this must be the exact `@gmail.com` address you use to authenticate, not a workspace alias)

#### 3. Create OAuth credentials

1. Go to [Google Auth Platform > Clients](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/clients) > Create Client
2. **Application type**: Desktop app
3. Click **Create**
4. Go to [APIs & Services > Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials), find your client, and click the download icon to get the JSON
5. Save the file as `~/.mailbox-mcp/oauth-keys.json`

#### 4. Authenticate

In Claude Code, run: `authenticate alias="personal" provider="gmail" email="you@gmail.com"`

This opens a browser window to complete the OAuth flow. Your tokens are stored locally in `~/.mailbox-mcp/accounts/`.

### Add an IMAP Account

In Claude Code, run:

```
authenticate alias="work" provider="imap" email="you@company.com" host="imap.company.com" smtpHost="smtp.company.com" username="you@company.com" password="<app-password>"
```

Credentials are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM.

### Add a JMAP Account

In Claude Code, run:

```
authenticate alias="fastmail" provider="jmap" email="you@fastmail.com" host="fastmail.com" username="you@fastmail.com" password="<app-password>"
```

JMAP auto-discovers the API endpoint via `.well-known/jmap`. Credentials are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM.

**Supported JMAP servers:** Fastmail, Stalwart, Topicbox, Cyrus IMAP, and any RFC 8620-compliant server.

**JMAP advantages over IMAP:**
- Native thread support (real conversations, not synthetic)
- Server-side search (faster, more accurate)
- Batch operations in a single HTTP request
- No persistent connection required

## Choosing which tools load

49 tool schemas cost roughly 6,000 tokens in clients that load every definition into context. In everyday use a handful of tools do most of the work, so you can expose only the groups you need with `MAILBOX_MCP_TOOLS` (comma-separated). Unset means everything loads.

```json
"env": {
  "MAILBOX_MCP_TOOLS": "core,attachments"
}
```

| Group | Tools | What it covers |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| `core` | 17 | accounts, search, read, send, reply, forward, create/list/send draft, inbox summary |
| `organize` | 9 | labels, star, archive, trash, modify |
| `bulk` | 4 | query-wide modify/trash with dry-run and undo (undo restores trash on Gmail, IMAP, and JMAP) |
| `attachments` | 3 | download attachments, export `.eml` |
| `gmail-extras` | 16 | filters, templates, signatures, vacation, unsubscribe, send-as, update/delete draft |

`create_draft` on IMAP returns a `folder:uid` id that `send_draft` can send.

Calls to tools in disabled groups fail with an error naming the group to enable.

## Sending attachments

`send_email`, `reply_email`, `forward_email`, and `create_draft` accept an optional `attachments` parameter — an array of local file paths. The server reads each file, detects its MIME type from the extension, and embeds it in the outgoing message (or draft).

```
send_email account="personal" to=["friend@example.com"] subject="The report" body="See attached." attachments=["/path/to/report.pdf", "/path/to/chart.png"]
```

- Each file must be a regular file ≤ 25 MB; total per message is capped at 25 MB (Gmail's hard limit).
- Paths are resolved through any symlinks, and filenames are stripped of CRLF before going into headers.
- Gmail routes messages with attachments through the multipart upload endpoint (35 MB API limit) instead of the JSON endpoint, so the 25 MB message cap is the real ceiling.
- JMAP uploads each file to the server's upload URL first, then references the resulting blobIds in the Email/set call.

## Choosing the sender address

One account often speaks for several addresses. `send_email`, `reply_email`, `forward_email`, `create_draft`, and `update_draft` accept an optional `from` parameter; without it, the account's primary address is used.

```
reply_email account="personal" message_id="18f..." from="jean@example.com" body="Thanks, sorted."
```

Accepted forms are `alias@example.com` and `Name <alias@example.com>`; matching is case-insensitive.

The address is checked against the account before anything is sent, and the call fails with the list of usable addresses if it doesn't match. This matters because Gmail silently falls back to the primary address when the `From` header names an address you haven't verified, so a message can be sent from the wrong identity and still look like it succeeded. Some recipients (Amazon's customer service, for one) reject mail that doesn't come from the address on file.

- Gmail: the address must be a send-as alias with verification completed. Run `list_send_as` to see them. Pending aliases are refused.
- JMAP: the address must match one of the account's identities; its `identityId` is attached to the submission.
- IMAP: no alias list exists to check against, so any `from` is passed to the SMTP relay, which accepts or rejects it at send time.
